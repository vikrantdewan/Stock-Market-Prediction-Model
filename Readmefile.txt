Project Title
Stock Market Prediction  Using Sentimental Analysis
We used Machine learning techniques to evaluate past data pertaining to the stock market and world affairs of the corresponding time period, in order to make predictions in stock trends. We built a model that will be able to buy and sell stock based on profitable prediction, without any human interactions. The model uses  SENTIMENT ANALYSIS  to make smart “decisions” based on current affairs, article, news feeds etc. With NLP technique and the basic rule of probability, our goal is to increases the accuracy of the stock predictions. 
we investigate the relationship between Twitter feed content and stock market movement. 
Specifically, we wish to see if, and how well, sentiment information extracted from these feeds can be used to predict future shifts in prices. 
To answer this question, we construct a model, estimate its accuracy, and put it to the test on real market dataset.


Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

Prerequisites
download Python 3.6 or above based on your OS  //https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-366/
download pycharm community version latest version 2018.3 or above based on your OS //https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows
download Anaconda 5.3.1 for python 3.7 //https://www.anaconda.com/download/
Anaconda Documentation //https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/

After you have installed the above softwares follow the below steps to open the project source code in Pycharm, unzip the file in a place as per your preference.
Now open up Pycharm and browse to the loacation where you have unziped the project folder earlier.
After the the source code is opened in Pycharm, import the necessary libraries if not imported, which are as below.

Pandas
numpy
sklearn
matplotlib

To install these libraries, press keys ctrl + alt + s, a setting dialouge box will appear. 
In the dialouge box expand your project folder name present in left side of the dialouge box. You'll be seeing two options, go on and click "Project Interpreter" option.
	Note: Make sure to select python version as 3.6 in the only dropdown.
After this, please select the '+' icon to add a library, you can see this icon in extreme right adjacent to latest version column.
Now you'll see a new "Available Packages" dialouge box, now in this search the above mentioned libraries, select them and click the install Package button available at lower left.

Now once above steps are followed, you're ready to run the project.

To run the project, double click on the .py folder and once it appears on right side, right click on that and select option as "Run openedfolder.py" and once you click run a terminal window will pop up with the result.
